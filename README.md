Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the 'CDC Diabetes Health Indicators' dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The primary objective is to preprocess the data and apply various machine learning models to predict diabetes status. I will use nonlinear models such as Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and neural networks including Perceptron and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Dataset
The dataset contains health indicators related to diabetes, provided by the CDC. It can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: CDC Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset.

Steps and Methods
Data Loading:

Download and read the data from the UCI repository as a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Implement techniques to handle any missing data appropriately.
Categorical Variables: Encode categorical variables using methods such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Dataset Preparation:

Split the dataset into Input features (X) and Target variable (y).
Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets in a 70%, 20%, and 10% ratio, respectively.
Modeling:

Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network:

Implement RBF kernel functions.
Train the RBF model using suitable optimization techniques.
Tune hyperparameters like the number of basis functions and regularization strength.
Perceptron:

Apply a basic Perceptron model to the training data.
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):

Design the MLP network architecture.
Implement forward propagation and backpropagation algorithms.
Train the MLP model using gradient descent or its variants.
Experiment with different activation functions and network structures.
Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden layers/nodes.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the nonlinear models on the test data.
Compute evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Plot learning curves to analyze model convergence and overfitting.
